## **How To Use daos**
> The following steps are in order
1. The developer creates a kind of dao template. This template determines which transactions users can execute and how.
This template uses daos with very little extra code.
2. Users can create any number of DAO with one click according to template rules.
3. The creator of the DAO sets the Origin of the transactions executable by the DAO through the sudo module, and modifies some Storage in the square and agency modules, if necessary.
4. The creator of DAO removes root privileges, and DAO achieves decentralization.
5. DAO users implement steps 3 and 4 through the square or agency module but not sudo module.
   That is, voting together to decide all transactions in the dao.
