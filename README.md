# daos

## Introduce
We don't care about the implementation of your DAO's specific behavior, this can be handed over to every developer who provides behavior templates. We provide an abstraction layer to make it easier for each DAO to manage each related specific behavior, and how to quickly create a DAO based on daos.
***
* As a developer, you can just focus on the design of the behavior template, leave the governance rules to us.
* As a user, you can create any number of daos for yourself based on the behavior template.
* As an eco-builder, this can help you really create groups, focus on sinking markets and hear small but meaningful voices. Help you achieve greater decentralization.
* **Each DAO can perform external transactions as an ordinary user through intra-DAO governance**
* **Each DAO's governance can evolve on its own.**
