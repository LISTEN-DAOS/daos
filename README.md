# daos
## Introduce
* As a developer, you can just focus on the design of the behavior template, leave the governance rules to us.
* As a user, you can create any number of daos for yourself based on the behavior template.
* As an eco-builder, this can help you really create groups, focus on sinking markets and hear small but meaningful voices. Help you achieve greater decentralization.
* **Each DAO can perform external transactions as an ordinary user through intra-DAO governance**
* **Each DAO's governance can evolve on its own.**
