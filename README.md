# daos
## Our goal
It's cool that you can build various DAOs for substarte-built projects based on simple code implementations.
## Develop
* rust
`curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh`
* Clone Project From Github
`git clone https://github.com/DAOS-TEAM/daos.git`
* Build
```angular2html
cd daos
cargo build --release
```

## Introduce
A DAO can be abstracted as a group of people doing something together. From the chain's point of view, these outputs are fixed and clear.

This limited number of methods can be reduced to a single category, which is all the tools needed to achieve the overall grand goal. Any group that wants to achieve the same goals and do the same things, use this category. So, what's different about these groups, is that they're based on these methodological rules,

Groups give each specific method how mass rights. In a decentralized world, power boils down to referendums and specific power agencies. If absolute decentralization is pursued, the ideal solution must be one person, one vote, a referendum. However, there is a problem, that is, the efficiency of governance in this way is very low, and the will of the people is often not satisfactory.

Not every issue is worth the attention of the public, and referendums are not enough to deal with emergencies, so we came up with a way for the public to give some power to a proxy,

In this way, when an emergency occurs, it is handled by an agency. From the above, we can conclude that every public method on the chain requires an executive right, whether it's a referendum or an institution,

Or it can be both. The main thing DAOS does is have groups grant rules (institutions, referendums) to methods in each category, and these rules are dynamic.

Any developer can create a DAO template with one click, and these DAO templates can be used by different groups of people with different needs.

The prerequisite for this is that the design of DAOS should be abstract enough. It does not need to consider how people vote or how specific institutions are elected.

Free design by the developer. Daos is right distribution, it is free in all the outer design of specific groups, as long as you are in a project with DAO has a referendum rights agency requirements, and different groups to do similar things, such as social room management software, such as asset management, such as each project ico, then this project is your best choice.
